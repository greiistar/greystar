              <h3>Hi, I'm Greystar</h3>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greystar is a nonbinary electronic music producer and pianist 
                based out of Portland, OR. Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, 
                they spent their early years bouncing from place to place, relying on 
                memory, music, and the internet for homely comforts. Their music reflects a 
                feeling of wander and nostalgia, a vision without a genre or a home.
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greystar’s music has evolved greatly over the years, 
                demonstrating their flexibility of styles and production. Much of their 
                early work dabbled in the realms of ambient, noise, and braindance, while 
                their most recent work has evolved into gritty industrial techno, vocal-infused 
                ambient, and drum & bass. Their influences include the work of Arthur Russell, 
                Aphex Twin, and Brian Eno, as well as dub music, footwork, and breakcore. 
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside of creating music, Greystar has been deeply involved 
                in organizing shows both virtually and physically, and creating online spaces for 
                other musicians to thrive. Throughout 2021, they were apart of virtual festival 
                communities and tasked with scheduling, streaming, and performing live in online 
                spaces. Coming out of quarantine, they have been performing at electronic venues 
                and raves regularly since then.
